For a long time it puzzles me how something so expensive so leading edge, 
     would be so useless. And then it occurered to me that a computer is a stupid machine 
     with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are 
     smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things. They are in short , a perfect match
